`[DiGraph`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/<manim.mobject.graph.DiGraph.html#manim.mobject.graph.DiGraph> "manim.mobject.graph.DiGraph") | A directed graph.  
---|---  
`[GenericGraph`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/<manim.mobject.graph.GenericGraph.html#manim.mobject.graph.GenericGraph> "manim.mobject.graph.GenericGraph") | Abstract base class for graphs (that is, a collection of vertices connected with edges).  
`[Graph`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/<manim.mobject.graph.Graph.html#manim.mobject.graph.Graph> "manim.mobject.graph.Graph") | An undirected graph (vertices connected with edges).  
`[LayoutFunction`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/<manim.mobject.graph.LayoutFunction.html#manim.mobject.graph.LayoutFunction> "manim.mobject.graph.LayoutFunction") | A protocol for automatic layout functions that compute a layout for a graph to be used in `change_layout()`.
